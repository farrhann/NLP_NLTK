    "e1=\"Every summer, the pastoral call of their motherland, Kerala, beckoned my parents. Their children would plead that they change direction at least for one year but these entreaties were dismissed as flakiness. Summer months were set in stone. And contrary to the breezy, game-for-anything attitude that the sun induced in many folks, for my mother and father, it was a season for constancy.\"\n",
    "e2=\"J R.R. Tolkien was right to portray the Ents, hulking pieces of tall barks with sad eyes and mossy facial hair who guarded forests, as perhaps the most stoic figures in his Lord of the Rings trilogy. Their whole manner spoke to an endurance that seemed constantly on the verge of dissipation. They had seen and tolerated far too much in a world at war with itself. Yet they remained calm, like a steady lighthouse in torrential downpour.\"\n",
    "e3=\"Once-in-a-lifetime is an overused expression in travel. Like everything else, the phrase has succumbed to a culture of instant hype. When every mountain hike, underwater dive or local meal is described with the glowing praise that should be meant for only the rarest of occurrences, it is difficult to tell a wonderful experience from a bucket list one. A bucket list just doesn’t translate with the same impact it was originally intended for.\"\n",
    "e4=\"New and exciting has always received top billing in food—the latest fad, the newest restaurant, the trendiest neighbourhood, the healthiest diet. Often, these developments are accompanied by breathless pundit-like pronouncements: Lebanese is the new Chinese; Chinese is new Italian (wait, where does leave that Italian then?) A cuisine or dish has a moment, peaks and then becomes passé.\"\n",
    "e5=\"In this modern agnostic world, pop culture is the closest thing we have to a shared religion. Matinee idols, artists and rock stars are our gods and goddesses, feeding us an endless supply of enchanting lore and myths. For this movement to thrive though, it needs fans; followers who have gone beyond aloof observation. Pop culture requires that fans click below to subscribe, not let it just play in the background.\"\n",
    "e6=\"Part of the allure of a remote place is that the closer we get to it, the more we risk everything that made it precious. For years, Mount Everest inspired a sense of forbidden majesty, which was surmounted only by a few courageous adventurers. It helped that they were entertaining and we were content to immerse ourselves in the stories they wove from these monumental expeditions.\"\n",
    "e7=\"The world’s greatest cities are brutal, unsentimental places, precisely the reason why so many of us fall so irrevocably under their spell. In its worst hour, this bond can curdle into bitter complaints of unrequited affection and everyday torment. “The subway doesn’t work, trash is overflowing and it’s too crowded; this is over.” Let me assure you that right now someone somewhere is uttering these words about your dream metropolis, New York, Rome, Rio De Janeiro. Like an unrepentant cad, the city laughs in their face, “Go on… live without me.” Wresting long-term connections comes with the occasional pang of nostalgic regret. Those who can’t escape their love of cities are destined to keep replaying that first flush of romance, that moment when a city went from a destination to home.\"\n",
    "e8=\"As soon as a long, gleaming dark green train carriage, emblazoned with ‘Eastern & Oriental Express’ in engraved gold lettering slides into Hua Hin station, I feel a tinge of self-consciousness. Neither I nor my co-passengers from India are dressed for something this imperial. For the last hour, we have been milling about Hua Hin, Thailand’s oldest railway station—a quirky but fading royal artefact—in our baggy tees, jeans and dusty shoes, lugging backpacks and satchels. Once I hop aboard the train though, the air is less intimidating. While this is a majestic luxury locomotive boasting every accoutrement of refined sophistication, I see open, friendly faces in casual wear and summer hats.\"\n",
    "e9=\"After a tiring snorkelling session in the clear waters of Koh Phangan, instructors Captain Pumpui and Captain Poo are shepherding me and five others on a private speedboat to nearby Bottle Beach for a picnic lunch of sandwiches, macarons and fruit juices. I am about 10-12 kilometres from Belmond Napasai’s lush tropical resort in Koh Samui, my home for the last day-and-a-half, and the sun is blindingly bright overhead. This is ideal snorkelling weather; we have had a field day gasping at eels and corals underwater. But the heat has stymied chatter on our boat.\"\n",
    "e10=\"Leaning out from a bridge leading into Wat Rong Khun, I squint at a stucco moat of outstretched hands and grisly skeletons. Two massive horns arch over the walkway, while a few steps ahead, giant statues of Death and Rahu guard the entrance, like burly bouncers poised to restrict my entry into heaven. “The bridge of rebirth,” I overhear a foreign couple talking. A swampland of desire—enslaved arms—lie in wait blocking a mortal’s road to nirvana. This was rebirth as an infernal spectre, not Elton John’s PG-13 “Circle of Life.”\"\n"

    "new1=\"In a bid to ease paperwork for millions of tourists, the EU has proposed to make the Schengen visa process an online application system in the next few years. The Schengen visa allows travellers to visit and travel across 26 EU member nations for up to 90 days. Right now, tourists submit their visa application to a country’s local consulate and collect their passports in person once the visa is issued—a time-consuming process which became complicated during the last two years of the pandemic. The new proposal envisions a single digital visa application platform for all EU countries. Instead of a physical sticker, the visa is expected to be a cryptographically signed 2D bar code.\"\n",

International connections from Pune are rare (right now, Dubai is the sole one); visitors normally rely on Mumbai airport for the same. However, authorities are now planning to connect the city to two more Southeast Asian countries once the Singapore route is up and running.\"\n"
